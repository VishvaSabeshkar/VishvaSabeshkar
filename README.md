### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m Sabeshkar — a guy who loves learning, experimenting, and building anything that sparks curiosity.

If something interests me, I’ll dive into it head-first, break it apart, understand how it works, and keep improving until it feels right. I’m always exploring new ideas and leveling myself up one step at a time.

I enjoy working on things that challenge me and help me grow — especially when it comes to understanding how data, systems, and real-world problems connect.

When I’m not in front of the screen, you’ll probably find me working on my fitness goals, cycling, or watching movies.

#### Fun Facts:

* Currently on a journey to build an athletic body
* I cycle and train weekly
* Thriller-movie lover (recommend me one and I’ll tell you if I’ve watched it)
* I learn faster when I’m obsessed with something
