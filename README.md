Hey there!
I’m Sabeshkar, an IT undergraduate and an aspiring Data Scientist from Sri Lanka.

I love building things that make me curious — whether it’s a mobile app, a MERN project, or a machine learning model I’m still learning to finesse.

If something sparks my interest, I’ll research it, break it down, and try to build it… even if I have to learn the entire tech stack from scratch.

My current journey is all about Excel, Python, Machine Learning, and Power BI as I gear up for data science internships in 2025.

My main tech stack (so far) includes Python, SQL, MERN, and Kotlin, and I’m steadily growing my DS toolkit one project at a time.

I’ve built quite a few academic + personal projects already, including a MERN-based photography app and a Kotlin personal finance tracker.

If you want to follow my learning path or see how I’m leveling up my skills, my pinned repos are the best place to start.

Fun Facts:
• I’m a fitness enthusiast working towards an athletic body
• Big cycling + cardio guy
• Anime fan (ask me and I’ll rate your favorites)
• I like building things more than just thinking about them
